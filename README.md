Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are especially good at processing images and featurizing their shapes, edges, curves, and depth. As I've learned more about CNNs and applied them throughout my work, I found myself wanting to look deeper at these networks while applying them to something I find personally interesting. Architecture is the perfect means with which to explore this deeper. I've been fortunate to have traveled many places all over the world and experienced a wide variety of cultures. While traveling, I was always drawn to the unique architectures associated with different cultures - and how they becuase the pride of each location. I chose to process images of different home architectural styles. My reasoning:
  1) There are many home architectures that have very distinguishing features
  2) There are many resources for home images
  
 ## Data
 | Architecture | Train Images | Test Images |
 |--------------|--------------|-------------|
 | Tudor | 508 | 40 |
 | Modern | 600 | 49 |
 | Victorian | 476 | 41 |
 | Ranch | 426 | 42 |
 | Modern | 500 | 40 |
